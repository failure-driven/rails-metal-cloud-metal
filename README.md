How to host a rails app at home, move it to the cloud and back to on prem.

## Plan

loosely based on a conversation on [Ruby Australia #melb-meets Oct 5th Slack](https://rubyau.slack.com/archives/C010RUGPRHU/p1696480053027199?thread_ts=1696479747.231869&cid=C010RUGPRHU)

a guide for zero to hero and back again

- [ ] rails new
- [ ] add a DB, image storage and background processing
- [ ] run in production mode
- [ ] deploy locally - using capistrano and kamal
- [ ] deploy locally on docker
- [ ] host from home to the internet
- [ ] host on the dark web
- [ ] move to a cloud provider
- [ ] switch cloud providers
- [ ] ad multi availability zones (AZ)
- [ ] switch back to an on prem solution with redundancy
- [ ] review
    - [ ] what have we learnt?
    - [ ] cost comparison
    - [ ] smart deploy template?
