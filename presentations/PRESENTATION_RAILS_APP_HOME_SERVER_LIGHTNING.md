# Can I host a rails app from a home server?

```ruby
rails new
bin/rails server
bin/rails server RAILS_ENV=production ?????
```

---

## Demo

```
open http://...
stop server
http://... # reload
start server
http://... # reload
please clap 👏
```

## But Why?

---

## We have PaaS

- Heroku
- Fly.io
- Render
- Hatchbox

---

## And Cloud ☁️

- DigitalOcean Droplets
- Engine Yard
- Cloud66
- AWS AppRunner on AWS Fargate
- Linode ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

## So why run a home server?

- because I can

## Warning

> But he looked at where the site was hosted and it was hosted on a residential

## What's involved

- do you have a public IP?

```sh
open https://whatismyipaddress.com/

ipconfig getifaddr en0 # wireless
ipconfig getifaddr en1 # ethernet

dig -4 TXT +short o-o.myaddr.l.google.com @ns1.google.com # public
```

---

## What's going on?

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier-grade_NAT

> With CGNAT, end sites, in particular residential networks, are configured
> with private network addresses that are translated to public IPv4 addresses
> by middlebox network address translator devices embedded in the network
> operator's network, permitting the sharing of small pools of public addresses
> among many end users. This essentially repeats the traditional
> customer-premise NAT function at the ISP level.

> Carrier-grade NAT is often used for mitigating IPv4 address exhaustion.

## Escaping CGNAT

AWS EC2 with public IP address

- IP
- traffic
- reverse SSH

---

## Why not run it on EC2?

- instance size
- QRNG
- huge DB
- dice-o-matic

---

## Escaping CGNAT

what about Cloudflare tunnel

- demo

---

## What's next

- Mac OS deploy - launchd
- Docker
- Kamal
- Capistrano
- Ras Pi
- to Cloud
- to On-prem cluster
- Zimablade
