# Home Lab Cluster

**AIM:** can 2 or more people, get together and build personal "home lab"
clusters that they serve up as a cloud offering to run people's rails projects?
as a sort of PaaS (Platform as a Service)?

## Hardware

There are many options but it is likely that a relatively cheap and small
server that can run docker is about right. There are NAS (Network Attached
Storage) controllers that can run docker which would be able to provide some
basic compute as well as storage. Then there are single board computers like
the infamous Raspberry Pi (RasPi) which in theory everyone has 1 kicking around
somewhere. There has always been a bit of a "Home Lab" push for a desktop
cluster with the latest entrant being the
[ZimaBlade](https://www.zimaboard.com/blade/). But ultimately it would be best
if the hardware choice was as flexible as an old laptop laying around or a
cheap refurbished mini desktop computer or even a compute stick like the
[SC8-PRO](https://www.scorptec.com.au/product/branded-systems/pc-stick/95422-sc8-pro)
